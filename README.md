A secure chatroom using LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and RSA encryption would involve using LDAP for user authentication and authorization, and RSA encryption for secure communication between users.
The combination of LDAP for user authentication and authorization, and RSA encryption for secure communication, would provide a secure chatroom that ensures that only authorized users can access the chatroom and that their communication is protected from unauthorized access.

LDAP is a protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It can be used to authenticate users by verifying their credentials against an LDAP directory, and to authorize users by determining their access rights based on their LDAP group membership.

<h1> <img src = "https://github.com/Harpia-Vieillot/Harpia-Vieillot/blob/main/resources/analytics.webp" width="7%"> RSA </h1>
RSA encryption is a public-key encryption system that uses a pair of keys, one for encryption and one for decryption. It is widely used for secure data transmission, such as in secure chatrooms. In this chatroom, the RSA encryption would be used to encrypt messages between users to ensure that they can only be read by the intended recipient.
